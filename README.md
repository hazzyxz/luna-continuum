## 🌔 Overview

`luna-continuum` is a **public-facing Obsidian vault** — an ongoing experiment in thinking, writing, and learning in rhythm. Built upon the [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) framework, it automates the act of daily capture and reflection —  a space where ideas orbit, evolve, and align over time.

> _"Not everything grows in daylight — some thoughts need the calm of the moon."_

## 🪞 Philosophy

- **Work in Progress, Always**  
  Every note is a phase of thought — evolving with context, never static.

- **Low Friction, High Reflection**  
  Automated prompts (title, agenda, tags, mood) reduce resistance to writing.

- **PARA at the Core**  
  Projects and Areas stay alive; Resources and Archives preserve quiet continuity.

- **Continuum over Completion**  
  Knowledge is treated as a living stream — flowing, merging, revisited.
