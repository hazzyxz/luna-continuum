<h1 align="center">🌙 Luna Continuum 🌗</h1>

<p align="center"><em>A reflective, automated Obsidian vault for continuous learning and daily knowledge capture.</em></p>

> `luna-continuum` is my public-facing PARA-style notes repository — a living garden of ideas where small, steady iterations compound over time. The name nods to **lunar cycles** (rhythmic growth) and a **continuum** (unbroken flow).

## At a glance

- **Work-in-progress by design.** Notes evolve through tiny daily edits — not polished “final” docs.
- **PARA at the core.** *Projects* & *Areas* stay foregrounded; *Resources* & *Archive* keep context close but quiet.
- **Automation-first flow.** Daily pages open with a light prompt (title → agenda → tags) and prefilled sections to remove friction.
- **A record of learning.** Technical explorations, plans, and reflections — captured consistently, linked loosely, reviewed periodically.

## Why “Luna Continuum”?

- **Luna** → steady phases, gentle cadence, permission to iterate.
- **Continuum** → no hard resets; knowledge accretes and recombines.
- Together → *rhythmic, unbroken growth* in public.
