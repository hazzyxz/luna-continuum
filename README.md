## 🌙 What is Luna Continuum?

*A reflective, automated Obsidian vault for continuous learning and daily knowledge capture.*

> `luna-continuum` is my **public-facing PARA-style knowledge base** — a living repository of evolving thoughts, technical notes, and reflections.  
> It embraces **lunar cycles** (steady, rhythmic progress) and a **continuum** (unbroken flow of growth).

## 🌒 At a Glance

- 🧩 **Work-in-progress by design.**  
  Notes evolve through daily micro-iterations — never static, always growing.

- 🗂️ **PARA at the core.**  
  *Projects* & *Areas* surface current focus; *Resources* & *Archive* hold context in orbit.

- ⚙️ **Automation-first flow.**  
  Daily pages prompt for title → agenda → tags → mood, lowering friction to reflection.

- 📖 **A record of learning.**  
  From ABAP experiments to PLN contest protocols — captured consistently, linked loosely, reviewed cyclically.

|:--:|:--|:--|
| 🌕 **Luna** | Lunar cycles | Represents rhythm, reflection, and renewal — permission to iterate. |
| 🌊 **Continuum** | Flow of knowledge | No resets, only ongoing refinement — ideas accrete like tides. |
| 💫 **Together** | Harmony | A rhythm of motion and stillness — knowledge as a living orbit. |
