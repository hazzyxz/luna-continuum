# luna-continuum

*A reflective, automated Obsidian vault for continuous learning and daily knowledge capture.*

`luna-continuum` is my public-facing PARA-style notes repository. It’s the living home for projects, areas, resources, and archives—centered on daily notes that evolve over time. The name nods to lunar cycles (steady, rhythmic growth) and a continuum (unbroken flow of ideas).

## What this repo is

- **A digital garden of work-in-progress thinking.** Notes grow through small daily iterations rather than polished “final” docs.
- **A PARA-structured vault.** Projects and Areas surface the most relevant work; Resources and Archive keep the rest accessible but out of the way.
- **Automation-first.** Daily pages are generated with prompts (title, agenda, tags) and prefilled sections to lower friction and encourage writing.
- **A record of learning.** From technical explorations to planning and reflections—captured consistently, linked loosely, and reviewed periodically.
