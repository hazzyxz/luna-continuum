# Mistborn

> **Summary** — Working, spoiler-light reading notes for _Mistborn: The Final Empire_ to track characters, magic, themes, and questions while I read.

## Context
- Purpose: model how I’ll take novel notes in Obsidian (for future books too).
- Scope: light spoilers for early/mid book; big twists kept out of the main sections and flagged.
- Method: one-page hub linking out to chapter logs if needed; quick tables for magic + characters.

## Objectives / Outcomes
- Capture a **1–3 line summary per reading session**.
- Maintain an **Allomancy quick sheet** I can glance at during scenes.
- Track **character arcs** (Vin, Kelsier, Sazed, Elend, Crew).

## Key Points
- **World/Setup**: Ashfalls, mist-haunted nights; skaa oppressed under an immortal **Lord Ruler** and the **Steel Ministry** (Obligators + Inquisitors). Noble houses play brutal politics in **Luthadel**.

## Decisions
- **Spoiler discipline**: keep revelations out of “Key Points”; if needed, add a collapsible “Spoilers” section at the end.

## Open Questions
- What _are_ the mists doing at night—mere weather or something sentient/Invested?
- How exactly do the **Inquisitors** work (spikes, detection, limits)?
- Sazed’s metal storage art: boundaries, costs, and cultural origin.

## Tasks
- [ ] Clip 3 short lines I love (with ch./page).
- [ ] Build a per-character mini-timeline as I progress.
