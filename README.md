## Overview

`luna-continuum` is my public-facing **Obsidian vault** — built around the [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) method for organization, and automated daily note creation.  
It focuses on steady, low-friction capture and reflection — designed to grow gradually, like a continuous learning loop.

## Core Ideas

- 🧩 **Work in progress by default**  
  Notes are always evolving; nothing is treated as final.

- 🗂️ **PARA at the core**  
  *Projects* and *Areas* stay visible and active.  
  *Resources* and *Archive* keep older knowledge organized but out of the way.

- ⚙️ **Automation-first**  
  Daily notes open with prompts (title, agenda, tags, mood) to make writing effortless.

- 📚 **Continuous learning**  
  Technical notes, reflections, and plans are linked lightly and revisited periodically.

## Why “Luna Continuum”

- **Luna** → steady rhythm and cycles — a nod to consistency over intensity.  
- **Continuum** → knowledge that builds and flows without hard resets.  
- Together, they represent the idea of *learning as an ongoing process*.
